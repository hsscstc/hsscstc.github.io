                    <p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">The recent outbreak of covid-19 this year in January has caused huge impacts in supplies, daily lives and most importantly, education. Currently the number of  people infected has exceeded 90,000 on Mar 2nd and has killed over 2000 among those diagnosed with the virus. Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and even death. As there is no prescribed cure yet, the best practice is to avoid it. Governments have emphasised hygienic practices such as washing hands for at least 20 seconds, wearing masks, covering your nose and mouth when sneezing/coughing etc. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">The virusâ€™s outbreak has removed students and teachers alike from the physical learning environment in Hong Kong schools where interactions between the two groups are essential for student learning and feedback. During the outbreak, students and teachers were on a well deserved chinese new year holiday and were expected to return at the start of february. However, the government has issued multiple extensions, delaying school returns to Feb 17th, March 2nd and with the most recent extension to April 20th. As a result of these extensions, schools have decided to conduct learning through online platforms such as zoom and google hangouts until further notice. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Online learning has always been a form of learning since 1999 when it was first introduced solely for delivering information for students. However, with the rapid development of technology, many schools have been taking the advantages of learning online such as the ease it provides for both students and teachers. There is also research which supports the effectiveness of online learning.  Learning House, a company that manages online programs for colleges and universities, conducted a survey consisting of 1500 students investigating the effectiveness of online learning. Among those attending online and one-on-one courses, 85% said online learning is as good as or better than attending courses on campus.  However, the possible bias is that the company itself specialises in online programs, creating the logical assumption that the students in programs managed by this company would have a better learning experience online.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">In spite of the benefits of online learning, students who are used to the traditional learning in school often find online learning to be stressful. Because of the coronavirus, students are forced to convert their homes into an online learning environment in order to maximise the efficiency and engagement of e-learning.  Teachers would also have to convert their homes into a proper working environment in order to teach the students efficiently which also makes e-learning inflexible for them.  As a result of online learning at home, both students and teachers face much longer periods of using laptops which is unhealthy for our eyes as this can lead to tiredness  with the worst case being damaged eyesight. Because of the situation, many families have found themselves working from home alongside their children who have online lessons. While the potential point of spending more family time can be raised, the negative of working online is the lack of space for every family member to work in a suitable learning environment as there is inevitable noise pollution and a lack of privacy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Covid-19 also affects students applying to universities due to the travel restrictions imposed on china, preventing chinese students from travelling abroad and delaying applications. Tests which are required for specific countries and courses such as SATs for American universities and LNATs for students applying to law will most likely have their results delayed. The universities also suffer a huge loss economically as they have to cancel study abroad programs to china and chinese student recruitment will have to be put on hold.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">To conclude, covid-19 has impacted education in Hong Kong and China significantly. This results in students facing major changes to their learning environment and methods, which will impact their education unpredictably While students and teachers have converted to online learning currently, itâ€™s uncertain how sustainable e-learning is as a learning tool. However, there will be more concerns regarding the suspension of students as long as the virus remains and student learning will inevitably face more changes impacting students, parents and teachers alike. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; ">References:</span></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"><span style="font-size: 18px; ">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</span></a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://higheredrevolution.com/importance-and-effectiveness-of-e-learning-9513046ed46c"><span style="font-size: 18px; ">https://higheredrevolution.com/importance-and-effectiveness-of-e-learning-9513046ed46c</span></a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2018/06/18/most-students-say-online-learning-is-as-good-or-better-than-face-to-face.aspx"><span style="font-size: 18px; ">https://campustechnology.com/articles/2018/06/18/most-students-say-online-learning-is-as-good-or-better-than-face-to-face.aspx</span></a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.talentlms.com/elearning/history-of-elearning"><span style="font-size: 18px; ">https://www.talentlms.com/elearning/history-of-elearning</span></a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/02/13/longer-coronavirus-crisis-persists-bigger-likely-impact-chinese-student-enrollments"><span style="font-size: 18px; ">https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/02/13/longer-coronavirus-crisis-persists-bigger-likely-impact-chinese-student-enrollments</span></a></p>
